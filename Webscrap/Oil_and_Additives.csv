Features:

Solid Lubrication: Liqui Moly Oil Additive MoS2 Shooter is a solid lubricant that adheres to metal surfaces in the engine. When added to the engine oil, it forms a durable and friction-reducing film on engine components, such as pistons, rings, and bearings.
Friction Reduction: One of the primary functions of MoS2 is to reduce friction between moving engine parts. This friction reduction can lead to improved engine efficiency, reduced wear and tear on engine components, and potentially better fuel economy.
Cold-Start Protection: During cold starts, when engine oil may not have fully circulated, MoS2 provides an additional layer of protection. It helps prevent dry starts by offering lubrication until the engine warms up and the oil flows more freely.
High-Temperature Stability: MoS2 is known for its ability to withstand high temperatures without breaking down. This makes it suitable for use in engines exposed to high-temperature conditions, such as high-performance and turbocharged engines.
Engine Longevity: The reduced friction and wear provided by MoS2 can contribute to longer engine life. By minimizing metal-to-metal contact and protecting engine components, it helps extend the overall durability of the engine.
